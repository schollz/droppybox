Overview
=========

*gojot* is a modern command-line journal that is distributed and encrypted by default.


Ok. But, really, *gojot* is just a fancy wrapper for ``git`` that allows
you to make time-stamped entries to encrypted documents while keeping
the entire document synchronized. *gojot* is great for a *distributed
and encrypted* journal and is compatible with all magojor operating
systems. *gojot* is a single binary (with a text-editor built-in!), so
you only need ``git`` to get started and is compatible any local repo or
hosted service (`Gitlab`_/`Bitbucket`_/`Github`_).

Here's what it looks like in action (`check if its encrypted`_):
