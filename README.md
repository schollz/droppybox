*gojot* is a modern command-line journal that is distributed and encrypted by default.

Ok. But, really, *gojot* is just a fancy wrapper for `git` that allows you to make time-stamped entries to encrypted documents while keeping the entire document synchronized. *gojot* is great for a *distributed and encrypted* journal and is compatible with all major operating systems. *gojot* is a single binary (with a text-editor built-in!), so you only need `git` to get started.

More info can be found in [the documentation](https://gojot.schollz.com/).

_Note_: The previous non-`git` version of *gojot* can [be found here](https://github.com/schollz/gojot/tree/1.X).


Features
--------
-  *Only one* dependency: `git` (version 2.5+)
-  Single binary, Cross-compatibility (Windows/Linux/OS X).
-  Fulltext encryption using OpenPGP, compatible with `gpg`.
-  Filename encryption using ChaCha20.
-  Built-in text editor, `micro` (but options for
   `emacs`/`vim`/`nano`).
-  Built-in version control (all versions are saved, currently only
   newest is shown).
-  Searching, summarizing, synchronized deletion, self-updating,
   collision management, and more.
